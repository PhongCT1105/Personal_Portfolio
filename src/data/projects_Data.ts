      title: 'AI-powered Wedding Image Management',
      description:
        'Developed an AI-powered solution to optimize the storage, retrieval, and organization of wedding album images. Implemented an Image Clustering Deep Learning system using Azure AI vision for CNN-based image analysis, Cosmos DB for vector database storage, and Blob Storage for original image storage. Collected and designed a processing pipeline for 5000 images, fine-tuned model, and evaluated performance. Enhanced model accuracy by 15%, secured Proof of Concept approval, projected a potential $27,000 in revenue.',
